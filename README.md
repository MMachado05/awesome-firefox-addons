# A List of Excellent Firefox Add-Ons (By Use Case)
This is an ongoing list of add-ons for Firefox I find that I feel are particularly good at what they aim to do, and that I feel more people should be aware of.

Feel free to make an Issue if you feel there's a phenomenal add-on missing from this list!
