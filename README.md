# A List of Excellent Firefox Add-Ons (By Use Case)
This is an ongoing list of add-ons for Firefox I find that I feel are particularly good at what they aim to do, and that I feel more people should be aware of.

## General Purpose
* [Progressive Web Apps](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pwas-for-firefox/): Turns websites into stand-alone applications when requested - only available for websites that support the PWA format.

## For Students
* [Simplify](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/simplify-jobs/?utm_source=simplify&utm_medium=copilot): Will automatically fill out job applications with pre-set information you provide. The company also maintains a [GitHub page](https://github.com/SimplifyJobs) where they host a repo listing hundreds of software internships for summer of the relevant year.
